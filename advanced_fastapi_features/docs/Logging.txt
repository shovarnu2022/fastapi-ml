> Logging is a fundamental debugging practice in development
> Instead of using print(), we use python's logging module, which is more powerful and configurable
> Logging helps with:

> Track what part of the app was accessed
> Log variables and errors
> Retain logs in files or forward them to monitoring systems


Log Levels:

DEBUG: Low-level system information
INFO: Routing information like successful requests
WARNING: Something unexpected happened
