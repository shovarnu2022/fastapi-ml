> Caching is the process of storing a copy of data or computational results in a temporary storage layer

> This is done so that future requests for that same data can be served much faster, without needing to recompute or fetch it
from the original source


Importance******

> Reduces Latency

> Improves performance

> reduces Load on Backend

> Scalability



Types of caching:

> Client side caching: Done in browsers or frontends using mechanism like HTTP headers (Cache-Control)

> Server side caching: Caching happens on the server using tools like Redis, Memcached, or in-memory dictionaries

> CDN caching: Content delivery networks cache static resources close to users for faster load times

  * A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of geographically distributed servers that work together for content (websites, videos, images, scripts, etc.)
    to users more efficiently and reliably
  * Instead of every user fetching content from a single central server (which can be slow or get overload), a CDN caches and serves
    content from a server that is geographically closer to the user
  * This reduces latency, speeds up loading times, and improves scalability and availability


Key considerations with caching:

* Cache Invalidation: When data changes, how do you ensure the cache is updated? this is a crucial challenge in caching systems

* Caches have limited memory, so older or less-used data must be removed using strategies like:

  - LRU (Least recently used)
  - LFU (Least frequently used)
  - FIFO (First in First out)

* Consistency: Make sure cached data doesn't become stale or inconsistent with the source
