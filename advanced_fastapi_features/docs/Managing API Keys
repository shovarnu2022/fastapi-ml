What is an API Key?

An API Key is like a password for accessing a web service
It's a long string of letters and numbers that:
 > Identifies who is making the request
 > Verifies whether they have permission to access the data/service
 > Helps the API provider track usage


Why do we need API Keys?

1. Authentication and Authorization
   > To verify that a request id coming from a trusted source
   > Some APIs have public access, but many restrict data to authenticated users.


2. Rate Limiting:
   > Prevents abuse by limiting how many requests a single user or app can make in a given time
   > Without API Keys, it's hard to control spam or overload

3. Usage tracking:
   > Helps the API provider analyze how their service is being used
   > Enables billing or quota enforcement for paid APIs


4. Security

   > Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions
   > Can be revoked or rotated if compromised
