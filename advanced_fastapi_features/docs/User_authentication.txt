> The main idea is to protect an API route so that only authenticated users with a valid token can access it

> oauth2_scheme is a dependency provided by FastAPI:

  > Extracts the token from Authorization header
  > Automatically makes the token string available for further use

> decode_token(token) is a placeholder to implement the logic:

  > Validate the token
  > Decode the token
  > Return the user data embedded in the token

> get_current_user(): Makes user info available to routes

> Depends(get_current_user): Protects the route - only accessible if authenticated
