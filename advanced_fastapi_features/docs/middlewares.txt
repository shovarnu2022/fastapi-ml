> cross origin resource sharing
> Allows cross origin requests from browsers
> Injects the proper headers in the http responses so that compliant browsers will permit or reject those cross origin calls
> helps declare exactly which external origins, http methods, headers (and even whether credentials/cookies) are allowed.

> allow_origins: which domains are permitted to make browser based requests
> allow_credentials: whether to let the browser send cookies
> allow_methods: which actions will be accepted
> allow_headers: which headers will be accepted


Gzip Middleware:

> Used to compress HTTP requests before sending to client
> reduces the size of data transferred over the network
> Faster page loads
> Lower bandwidth usage
> Improved performance

HTTPSRedirectMiddleware:

> Ensures that all incoming HTTP Requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
> Enforcing HTTPS is a modern security standard, which is preferred by many platforms (browsers, Google SEP Ranking)


Custom Middleware:

> Define a class for the middleware
> Implement the dispatch method which contains the logic
> Register the middleware
> Add a route to handle requests
> Run the endpoints
